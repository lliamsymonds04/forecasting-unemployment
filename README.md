# Forecasting Unemployment
[WEBSITE](https://forecasting-unemployment.vercel.app/)

[Backend Link](https://github.com/lliamsymonds04/forecast-unemployment-backend)

This website uses PyTorch on the backend and data from the ABS to forecast unemployment based on Interest and Inflation Rates.

The front end is made using React and Tailwind. The graphs are made on the backend using matlab.

The backend is made using python and flask. This was my first project developing a backend :D
